              I'm a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect technical documentation that blends
              thoughtful design with robust security engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of clear
              communication and cybersecurity, creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built
              for performance and security.

              Currently, I'm a Senior Technical Writer at <span className="text-primary">SecureTech</span>, specializing

              our platform, ensuring our documentation meets industry standards and best practices to deliver an
              inclusive user experience.
